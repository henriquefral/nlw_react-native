About
=========
The project is called "gameplay", and it is a "diary" of games that must be played on the day.

With the possibility to create new matches of a certain game and invite others to play too. The others who will play in the task will be registered.

For example: User X creates a reminder of a game at 06:00PM, he sends the link of this reminder to his friends, users Y and Z clicked on the link.

User X's reminder will say that he has a match at 06:00PM with friends Y and Z.
